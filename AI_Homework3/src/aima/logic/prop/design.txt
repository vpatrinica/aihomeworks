The PEParser class is an LL(k) recursive descent parser which creates an Abstract Syntax Tree for any propositional logic expression.
Parantheses ARE importantfor this version of the parser. 
Each Node of the tree is a nonterminal from the grammar for Propositional Logic (fig 7.7 in AIMA 2nd edition).
For any operation that involves traversing the tree, there is a "Visitor" class,
which traverses the tree (eg: the CNFTransformer class );
(see "The visitor Design Pattern" in Design Paterns by Gamma et al for details ).
